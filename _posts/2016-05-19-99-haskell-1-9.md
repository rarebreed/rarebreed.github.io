To get some practice in, I decided to try out the [99 Haskell problems][-99-haskell] and convert them into purescript.
More than just solutions, I want to describe how the solution works.

# Problems 1-9: lists

## Problem 1: Find the last element of a list

As a bonus, I will do this with Arrays and Lists!  First up, lists

```haskell
import Prelude
import Data.List (List, Cons)
import Data.Maybe (Maybe)

myhead :: List a -> Maybe a
myhead Nil = Nothing
myhead (Cons Nil) = Nothing
myhead (Cons h (Cons t)) = Just h
```

Next up, arrays
