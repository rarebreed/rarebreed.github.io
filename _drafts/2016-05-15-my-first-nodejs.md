I'm going to rewrite pheidippides using purescript and some node libraries.  However, I'm still in the process of
learning purescript, but javascript doesn't seem too hard to grok.

My first task is to make a file system watcher.  I want to find out when a directory has a new file added, and if a
new file is added to get the file extension.  Eventually I want the application to send notification events to other
interested parties.
