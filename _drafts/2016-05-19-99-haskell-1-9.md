It's always a challenge to find problems to solve while learning a new language.  They can't be so easy and trivial that
you don't learn anything from them, but they can't be so hard that you give up in frustration.  So I decided to kill two
birds with one stone and select several classic computer science problems to solve:

- Create a persistent red-black tree
  - Iterate over
- Build a recursice descent parser 


To get some practice in, I decided to try out the [99 Haskell problems][-99-haskell] and convert them into purescript.
More than just solutions, I want to describe how the solution works.

# Problems 1-9: lists

## Problem 1: Find the last element of a list

As a bonus, I will do this with Arrays and Lists!  First up, lists

```haskell
import Prelude
import Data.List (List, Cons)
import Data.Maybe (Maybe)

myhead :: List a -> Maybe a
myhead Nil = Nothing
myhead (Cons Nil) = Nothing
myhead (Cons h (Cons t)) = Just h
```

Next up, arrays
