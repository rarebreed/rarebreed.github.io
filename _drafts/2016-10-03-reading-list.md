I've got like a book problem.  I really buy way too many books, and they sit with just one or two chapters ever read.
I'm going to resolve to start reading more of the books I've bought and sit at my computer less (unless the books are
only on pdf).  It dawned on me, after finding a pile of Dragon magazine articles, how much I used to read.  My life
as a pre-teen and teen was absorbed in books (especially role playing games).  My interest in role playing games and
wargames led me to read a fair bit of history books, and my interest in roleplaying games even sparked my interest
in martial arts.  I remember many a day, especially when it was rainy, curled up with one of my role playing games or
maybe reading one of the Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators books.  

# Roleplaying

Recently, I've been on a tear buying roleplaying games, mostly due to some good deals on bundleofolding.com.  I've
recently bought the following:

- Call of Cthulhu 7th edition
- Runequest 2nd edition
- Runequest adventures
- Mutants and Masterminds 3rd edition collection (PDF)
- Dragon Warriors collection (PDF)
- Iron Kingdoms collection (PDF)

Why so many?  I've always had a place in my heart for roleplaying games.  Being a nerdy and shy kid, it was to me the
best way to explore.  I owe alot to RPG's.  Lately, I have (re)started work on a long abandon game design which I am
beginning to implement in purescript.  Roleplaying game design (theory?) has changed a lot since I last played in the
early 90s; some for the better, some for the worse.  Most of the games above are "old school" systems.  Indeed,
Runequest was one of the original competitors to Dungeons & Dragons back in the day.  What I have noticed in more recent
games, is a move away from "crunchy" rules, to "lite" games that are very narrative and storytelling focused rather
than simulation focused.  

For me, these games will be used as motivational inspiration for Dao (my game system and world)

# Taiqi

A few week ago, I bought several books from YMAA.  I have bought some of Dr. Yang's books before

- Root of Qigong
- Taiqi theory
- Taichi of Wu and Li Styles
- Taichi Martial theory
- Taichi Qigong
- Taichi of Yang style

## Haskell Programming from First Principles

To understand purescript, you kind of have to know haskell.  While in some ways I prefer LYAH better, this book does go
into much greater detail.  It also covers things that LYAH does not.  Since Dao's core will be written in haskell and
purescript, it just makes sense to read this.

## Functional Programming in Java 8

This book is really interesting.  It's one of the best books I have read so far about functional programming in general.
In fact, it has one of the best explanations of monads I have seen (and does so only in an appendix).  This book is
primarily for work, since we do so much Java.

## Purescript by Example

The only book on purescript so far.  Although it assumes no experience with haskell, it doesn't do a great job of
explaining a lot of the syntax.  However, this is required reading for understanding the differences between it and
haskell, including Eff and Aff.

Since Dao will be running on the web, the front end is going to be in purescript and the backend will be in haskell.  

## WebGL Programming Guide (book)

Since I want to have a 3d world map, with 3d "miniatures", learning webgl is paramount.  A good learning exercise for
purescript will be converting the javascript snippets into purescript.

## HTML & CSS

A free book from Sitepoint, I need to learn all the new HTML5 goodies, and how to use CSS for the layouts.  Indeed, I
want to start writing the user content in raw html.

## Python Machine Learning

I have always been cuious about AI.  I especially want to do stuff with bayesian models, neural nets

## Category Theory for Programmers (web)
