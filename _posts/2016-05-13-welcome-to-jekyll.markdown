This will be my new blog going forward instead of using underaboddhitree.blogger.com.  I want to actually start
showing more code snippets, and showing code in blogger was just a pain in the butt.  I think having my blog as
part of my github pages is a better solution anyhow.  It will also help me learn more about CSS and html.

Mostly, I want to make programming fun and interesting again. I want to learn haskell and purescript to give me
a better understanding of programming, computer science and math.  I won't totally neglect clojure, but I think
it is time I pursued something like haskell more.

I am going to make an honest effort to cover the following topics in this new blog

- My learning of haskell/purescript
- My learning and exploration of the javascript ecosystem
- NoSQL database (probably ArangoDB)
- Some fundamentals of computer science
  - Data Structures
  - Parsing techniques
- Explore the relationship between Haskell and mathematics
  - Algebras
  - Category Theory
- More math fundamentals
  - linear algebra for use in WebGL
  - linear algebra for use in Machine learning
  - Calculus basics

To help put the above into a real-world context, I am going to go back to the drawing board on two projects:

- [pheidippides][-phei]
- lancer

pheidippides was my stab at creating a messaging system whose main use case was for RPC and event notifications
(think of a secure remote dbus).  I realized that clojure is not really the right approach for this.  I am
going to redo this in purescript on top of some nodejs libraries.

lancer was a stalled attempt at making a WebGL game.  I still want to do this, because I think it's a project
that can scratch all my itches.  It would need AI, lots of math for the 3d parts, parsing for custom data types,
data persistence via a NoSQL database and most importantly, it would just be fun.
