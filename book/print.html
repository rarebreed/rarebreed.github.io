                        <h1><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-khadga" id="introduction-to-khadga">Introduction to khadga</a></h1>
<p>This book is a small guide on how to create a web application using webassembly generated from rust.  It will take you
from knowing nothing about how to create wasm to how to generate both the front and back end code for your app.</p>
<p>The application that is generated here is a small chat application that will set up WebSocket connections between two
or more clients and the central web server.</p>
<p>If you're wondering where the name khadga comes from, it's a Sanskrit word meaning sword.  It is often referred to in
spiritual or mystical concepts as the sword that cuts away illusion.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-you-will-learn" id="what-you-will-learn">What you will learn</a></h2>
<p>This guide will walk you through everything required to develop, test and deploy both the front and backend application.
This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to write a (bleeding edge) asynchronous server using rust's warp framework</li>
<li>How to use wasm-bindgen, web-sys and js-sys crates to create a single page web app</li>
<li>How to serve your single page app from the async web server</li>
<li>How to deploy your app to Openshift Online using docker and source-2-image</li>
<li>How to set up unit and integration tests for the front and back end</li>
<li>How to set up a CI pipeline between your deployment and your tests</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#what-the-app-does" id="what-the-app-does">What the app does</a></h3>
<p>We will build the functionality of the app slowly in order to make it useful early on, but to build up functionality as
we go.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chat application</li>
<li>WebRTC for cam-to-Cam video conferencing</li>
<li>Video recognition</li>
</ul>
<p>First, we will start with a relatively simple chat application.  It will also cover things like setting up a database of
users and saved chat history.  It will also showcase how to do user authentication and authorization.</p>
<p>Second, we will enhance the app so that it will do video as well as text based chatting.  In this step, we will move from
a central server, to a peer to peer based system.  Chats can either be saved locally or stored on the discovery server.
This step will also show how to encrypt the streams for end to end encryption.</p>
<p>Lastly, we will build on the video streams enabled by the WebRTC to do image recognition.  We will use this as a toy to 
detect faces that are displayed and see if it is a known user.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#prerequisites" id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>
<p>This guide will cover how to scaffold and generate the initial wasm-pack code as well as a basic asynchronous web server
but it assumed that the reader is already familiar with:</p>
<ul>
<li>basic rust</li>
<li>basic html</li>
<li>basic css</li>
<li>basics of docker</li>
</ul>
<p>The reader's rust skills should be at a basic level.  One of the goals of the book is to explain some of the more tricky
rust concepts (or at least tricky to the author).  A basic understanding of rust ownership and lifetimes, and how
closures work will be required.  Understanding how Traits work, especially AsRef and From/Into will also be useful. The
async/await portions will be described in detail however.</p>
<p>The reader should have a basic level of HTML5 understanding.  This includes knowing what the DOM is and the basics of
common tags.  Most of the front end will be calling the web-sys bindings to the Web APIs, so it is useful but not
required to know javascript.  Because we are creating a single page app, knowledge of CSS will be useful, as the book
will not spend a lot of time explaining much of the CSS content.</p>
<p>For deployment, we will be using Openshift Online.  There is a free tier available and you can use this to deploy the
application.  In order to get the server to the cloud, we will need to create a container and therefore a docker image.
This will not be advanced, but there will not be a lot of explanation of what the docker file does.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#caveats" id="caveats">Caveats</a></h2>
<p>The biggest caveat is the author is new to this himself.  The decision to write the book was to help others so they do
not have to learn the hard way like the author did.  Also, the author is at a basic to intermediate level understanding
of rust.  There could very well be a better way to write the code and if so, please make a PR and contribute!</p>
<p>The second caveat was that this project made an opinionated stance on the technology used.  First and foremost was the
desire to use the new async/await syntax.  This lead to several <em>problems</em>.  For example, since async/await is still
only available in beta or nightly toolchains, most of the web frameworks still don't use the new syntax.</p>
<p>Another decision was to use as few libraries and especially frameworks as possible.  Partially, the choice was due to
frameworks not supporting the async/await syntax.  Another reason was simply to learn things the hard way.  While this
makes the code more tedious to write, it will also help illuminate for the reader how some things are done without the
help of a framework.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#why-not-yew" id="why-not-yew">Why not yew?</a></h3>
<p>Seasoned developers might ask why yew was not used for this project.  The simple answer here is that there was a desire
to use wasm-bindgen, web-sys and js-sys crates to create the app.</p>
<p>The author has no working knowledge of yew, and it was considered initially.  Afterall, it seems to tick off a lot of
the right boxes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built in virtual DOM</li>
<li>Macros to generate JSX like code</li>
</ul>
<p>However, yew is built on a crate called stdweb instead of wasm-bindgen, web-sys and js-sys.  The main difference is that
those libraries are created and maintained by the official Web Assembly Working Group.  It will therefore be more up to
date and have &quot;official&quot; support.  It was also designed to be language agnostic and the bindings are auto-generated from
the WebIDL schema.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#why-not-percy" id="why-not-percy">Why not percy?</a></h3>
<p>There is another framework that looked promising called percy.  It also has a virtual DOM and macro generator to create
some JSX-like code. Unlike yew, it is using wasm-bindgen and web-sys and js-sys crates. The problem with percy is that
because of some of the macros, it required a nightly toolchain.</p>
<p>Although nightly is great for individual learning and experimentation, it's not the best for teaching others.  The
brittleness of nightly means that what may compile one day for one person may not compile for another person (or the 
same person!) on another day.  It can also be hard sometimes to find a nightly build that allows all dependency crates
to be built successfully.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#setup" id="setup">Setup</a></h1>
<p>Now that you know what you will be building, let's get started setting up all the development
dependencies.  You'll need to have rust and npm set up as well as a few cargo tools</p>
<ul>
<li>rustup</li>
<li>npm (recommend using nvm)</li>
<li>cargo-generate</li>
<li>cargo-edit</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also checkout the github repository of khadga itself</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#installing-rustup" id="installing-rustup">Installing rustup</a></h2>
<p>If you haven't already, install <a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup</a> by following the directions.  If you
already have rustup installed, make sure it's at the latest and greatest (at the time of writing,
this is 1.38).  To update your rustup, do</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">rustup self update
rustup update
</code></pre>
<p>Next, you need to set up the wasm32 target so that rustc can compile to the wasm32-unknown-unknown
target triple</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
</code></pre>
<h3><a class="header" href="#other-rustup-goodies" id="other-rustup-goodies">Other rustup goodies</a></h3>
<p>While we are configuring rustup, we can install some other components as well</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">rustup component add llvm-tools-preview rustfmt clippy rls rust-analysis
</code></pre>
<h3><a class="header" href="#c-toolchain" id="c-toolchain">C(++) toolchain</a></h3>
<p>Some rust crates have native dependencies.  For example the openssl crate will use and link to a
native ssl lib on your system.  Because of this, it's sometimes necessary to have a C(++) toolchain
on your system as well.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#adding-cargo-tools" id="adding-cargo-tools">Adding cargo tools</a></h2>
<p>Although cargo is automatically installed by rustup, we are going to install some cargo additions.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cargo install cargo-generate cargo-edit
</code></pre>
<p>cargo-generate is a tool that will auto generate a template for you (and is used by wasm-pack) and
cargo-edit is a nice little cargo command that lets you add a dependency to your Cargo.toml (think
npm install).</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#setting-up-vscode" id="setting-up-vscode">Setting up vscode</a></h2>
<p>We'll be using the Microsoft VS Code editor, since it has good support for rust and is relatively
lightweight.  Because we are using some bleeding edge crates, we'll also have to specify some
additional configuration in the rust extension.</p>
<p>First, install <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">vs code</a> itself.  Once you have code installed, we need to install
the rust extension. You can either do this from the command line, or through VS Code itself.</p>
<pre><code>code --install-extension rust-lang.rust
</code></pre>
<p>While we are installing extensions, let's install a couple others that will make our lives easier:</p>
<ul>
<li>crates: To make it easier to see what the latest (stable) crate version is at</li>
<li>lldb debugger: So we can debug our code</li>
<li>toml: so we can get syntax highlights and coloring for our toml files</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>code --install-extension bungcip.better-toml
code --install-extension vadimcn.vscode-lldb
code --install-extension serayuzgur.crates
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#install-npm-and-nvm" id="install-npm-and-nvm">Install npm (and nvm)</a></h2>
<p>Since we are building a front end web app, we will be making use of some npm tools.  It's highly
recommended that you use the Node Version Manager (nvm) for this if you are on linux or MacOS.  For
windows users, you'll probably need to use chocolatey to install node (and npm).</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#linux-and-macos" id="linux-and-macos">linux and macos</a></h3>
<p>For linux and macos users, you can follow the directions here to install nvm.  Once you install nvm,
you'll need to actually install a node version.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nvm install 13
nvm use 13
</code></pre>
<h3><a class="header" href="#windows" id="windows">Windows</a></h3>
<p>For windows users, if you don't have chocolatey already, install that.  Then you can install node
(and therefore npm) with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">choco install nodejs  # make sure you run from an elevated command shell
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#installing-wasm-pack" id="installing-wasm-pack">Installing wasm-pack</a></h2>
<p>For this project, we will be using wasm-pack which will generate a template for us, as well as set
up a webpack config which will automatically compile our rust code to wasm.</p>
<p>You can install <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/">wasm-pack</a> here.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can install wasm-pack via cargo:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo install wasm-pack
</code></pre>
<h1><a class="header" href="#setting-up-the-project" id="setting-up-the-project">Setting up the project</a></h1>
<p>Now that we have all our dependencies out of the way, it's time to actually create our project.
Unlike many rust projects you will see on tutorials, we are going to have a fairly advanced cargo
setup.  We will be using a feature of cargo called workspaces to work on the front and back end.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#creating-your-initial-project" id="creating-your-initial-project">Creating your initial project</a></h2>
<p>First, create a directory then create a Cargo.toml file in it:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/Projects/weblearn
cd ~/Projects/weblearn
touch Cargo.toml
</code></pre>
<p>The Cargo.toml file will need to be edited to look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[workspace]

members = [
  &quot;backend&quot;,
  &quot;frontend&quot;
]
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#generating-the-machine-learning-project" id="generating-the-machine-learning-project">Generating the machine learning project</a></h2>
<p>Since this is a (partially) isomorphic web projectrunning rust on the backend, and a combined
webassembly/typescript front end (and a forthcoming rust IoT microcontroller sensor), we need a way
to generate the the frontend project so that our rust code compiles to wasm, and all the glue clode
to call to/from javascript functions can be done.</p>
<p>To set up the front end project you can go into your weblearn directory and run
the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm init rust-webpack mllib
</code></pre>
<p>This will generate a wasmpack style project that contains the code necessary for a combined rust and
javascript project.  Later, we will go into what files were generated, and how to build this
workspace, but for now, you can browse this new frontend directory.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#using-typescript" id="using-typescript">Using typescript</a></h3>
<p>However, we are using rust, so why would we want to use javascript with it's dynamic types? We will
enhance our project build code by allowing us to use typescript.</p>
<p>We will use a project called create-base-ts for this purpose.  It will scaffold a project for use
with typescript.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">npm init base-ts frontend
npx tsc
</code></pre>
<p>The above commands will install typescript as a dev-dependency in our package.json file, and the
<code>npx tsc</code> command will build our base project</p>
<p>We will tweak some of the configuration parameters later, once we build the project for the first

<h2><a class="header" href="#generating-the-backend-project" id="generating-the-backend-project">Generating the backend project</a></h2>
<p>The backend will be a typical rust web server using actix-web, so we can just use cargo for this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd /path/to/weblearn
cargo new backend
</code></pre>
<h1><a class="header" href="#frontend-navbar" id="frontend-navbar">Frontend Navbar</a></h1>
<p>First, let's start off with a very basic webpage.  Our end goal with this app is not to create
something beautiful, but simply as a way to get data from some agent (a human, being, an IoT
sensor, or another remote service for example) so that we can work on this data in real time.</p>
<p>Our initial goal is to provide a user interface for a human user (or some AI agent) to post
messages similiar to slack.  It's sort of half slack/gitter, half webchat in that the messages
should be persistenet and editable, but they should also be seen in a public forum (or privately).</p>
<p>A second goal is to provide video camera access to allow for video using WebRTC.</p>
<p>The SPA running on the users browser has 2 initial services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect messages from an agent and do text classification on it</li>
<li>Perform face recognition and eye tracking</li>
</ul>
<p>The very first thing we need to do is create a navigation bar</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#mongo-database" id="mongo-database">Mongo Database</a></h1>
<p>We need a way to store information that the app either needs or collects.  For example, we need to know
information about a user that signs up, and what permissions he or she has.  We also want a way to 
persist information about messages we receive so that we can operate on them later if needed.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will go over setting up a mongodb database, and in later chapters we will revisit
it to shore up security and create some new indexes to speed up searches.  This chapter will also
go over a docker set up to make it easier to set up our static backend files, and setup up the necessary
networking glue to get our rust actix server and databse to talk to each other</p>

<p>Authentication (AuthN) and Authorization (AuthZ) often get neglected in short tutorials, but we are not
going to do that here.  As a consequence, this is going to be a lengthy chapter covering what TLS
certificates are, how to create an https (vs. http) server, discussions on 2FA, and how to generate
JWT tokens to grant access to services.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#backend-server" id="backend-server">Backend Server</a></h1>
<p>We need a server to supply a couple of services we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Registration service for new users</li>
<li>Authentication service to provide JWT tokens</li>
<li>Signaling service so peers can send WebRTC media to each other</li>
<li>Message logging</li>
</ul>
